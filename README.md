# Houston (ArduCopter Version)
### Misison control tool for robotic systems


Houston is a mission control tool for robotic systems with the extended ability to generate and analyze tests. This version of Houston focuses on [ArduCopter](http://ardupilot.org/copter/), an open-source multi-UAV controller. The need for a tool such as Houston arises from the fact that humans are bad at creating tests, especially for robots.
